# revampjs
Inspired by ES6 deconstruct. A safe extract of js object properties into a new object

I am still working on the ergonomics of this helper library so breaking changes are to be expected at the moment.
Please feel free to open an issue if you have any suggestion.

## Plan
[] Finaliwe syntax of parameter for values extraction
[] Add test cases to demo the usage
[] Think of an alternative to the {...rest} from ES6
